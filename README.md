### What is the purpose of it?
If you want to download a Folder in Zip File Google Does that For you But Google will Zip the File in Parts..
But you want the File in 1 zip .. 
This Will Help you to Zip The File In once..
I tried Zipping a 5 Giga Bytes it Takes Some time But It works Perfectly..
I am Not Sure what is the Limit of this .
thanks
